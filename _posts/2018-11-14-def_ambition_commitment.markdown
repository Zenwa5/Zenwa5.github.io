I decided to take up Software Development as a challenge to myself. 

If there's one thing I've learned this year - it's that the time you spend matters. I want to spend my time being more productive and working towards an actual purpose. This blog is a reflection of that. 

I believe that learning these skills is naturally a great way for me to take my life (not just career) to a higher level. As an entitled millenial, I get bored easily. And as a person who gets bored easily - I want to make sure that I'm continuously challenging myself. Like a lot of people, I grew up with a natural fascination into computers and how everything relates together. Now that I'm finally in a position where I can commit the time to learning Software Development, I'm working hard on advancing myself. 

I'm learning Software Development to not only test myself, but to help me on my never-ending quest to attain knowledge. I want to push myself to be the best version of me. 

Flatiron School is helping me achieve that goal. 

```
def ambition(commitment)

   if commitment > 0
	   puts "Congratulations, keep going!"
 
   else
     nil
		 
	 end
	 
end
```
