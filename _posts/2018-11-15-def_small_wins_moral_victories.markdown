As of today this is my favorite piece of code:

```
def reverse_each_word(sentence1)
  new_array = []
  sentence = sentence1.split
  sentence.collect do |word|
  new_array << word.reverse
  end
  return new_array.join(" ")
end
```

It's an ugly piece of code and probably very inefficient, but the representation of it all is what matters to me. This is the moment I learned to truly think like a programmer. In Ruby, logic means eveyrhting. If there's a probelm, you can most likely code your way to the solution if you approach the problem correctly. Test Driven Development has been different to me than the other coding tools I'm used to. It's teaching me to think more logically and code as if I'm solving a problem and not out of route memorization....

(sorry for that run on sentence)


```def small_wins(moral_victories)
       until moral_victories > 0
			   puts "What is this trying to teach me?"
				 end
			end ```
