Aftrer learning a deeper dive into Ruby, I'm learning the toughest part about the holidays is learning to stay consistent. 


As a programmer, I'm sure that it's easy to get discouraged working on code. And my work during the holiday period is a reflection of that. I personally blame the massive amounts of food for my periodic disregard for my studies. My new years resoultion is to finish this program ahead of schedule so that I can focus on building the things that matter to me and finding new goals to slack off on. :)
